    <h2 id="About_Jay">About Jay</h2>
    <p1>For over twenty years I have worked in various fields that offered great skill development, but little overall satisfaction. 
        Through them I have built up my customer service skills, sharpened my sales experience, afforded me ample time to develop my interpersonal skills and work well in a team,
         and strengthened my problem solving capabilities. I have always had an interest in technology, and a knack for finding technical solutions. Merging that with researching, 
         testing, and implementing those solutions just made sense to me as a next step towards bettering my life and that of my family.</p1>
