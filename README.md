# Hardy-portfolio
project 2 portfolio
Read me file for week  mini project. Creating a website/portfolio. 
This weeks project was continuing to build off of what we had already done. The goal was to create a portfolio that we can use when it is time to look for a job. 
I was able to create the basic page easily, not saying it is all correct. But the shell of the page I was able to complete. I was also able to solve an issue I had in the previous project of having the navigation links function and move to a different section on the page. 
As I moved through this project, I noticed my code is messy and not in the best order. I also realize that I am putting things in and may not have a full understanding of why I am putting it in as I am, phrasing or location. I am just searching and using the answer I find.
As I continued to work on this project I was able to get it working properly, with excepotion to the responsive layout.
I was able to create a assets(although I spelled it assests) folder with the css in it.
